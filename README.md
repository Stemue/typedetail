Type Detail
----------

Type detail is an ongoing project by [Wenting Zhang](https://thenetawards.com/vote/talent/wenting-zhang/), inspired by the great discontent's [100 day project](https://thegreatdiscontent.com/100days) and Stephen Coles's great book [The Anatomy of Type](http://typeanatomy.com/). The rule and goal is to annotate a web typeface each day, pointing out the beautiful details of the type forms that often get overlooked.
