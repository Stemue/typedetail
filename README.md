# Type Detail
Type detail is an ongoing project by Wenting Zhang, inspired by the great discontent's 100 day project and Stephen Coles's great book The Anatomy of Type. The rule and goal is to annotate a web typeface each day, pointing out the beautiful details of the type forms that often get overlooked.
